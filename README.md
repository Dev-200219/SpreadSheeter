# SpreadSheeter

It is a Web App which I have build using VanillaJS, HTML and CSS as a personal project. It is a Spread Sheet App where a user can write data, style it, apply formulas to it, cut, copy and paste data from one range of cells to another. It also multi-sheet system i.e. a user can add new sheets for different data without affecting data in previous sheets. User can also download their sheet data as JSON and upload it again later to see it or make any changes to it. I have also used Graph's Cycle Detection Algorithm for user to visualize a cylic relation, if user inputs one by mistake.
